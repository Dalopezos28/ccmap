## ✅ After PostgreSQL is Added

Once your app deploys successfully (you'll see green checkmarks in Railway):

### 1. Install Railway CLI

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### 2. Login and Connect

```bash
railway login
railway link
```

### 3. Import the 265 Comedores

```bash
railway run python importar_comedores.py
```

Expected: `Total comedores: 265`

### 4. Create Admin User

```bash
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5. Open Your App

## 🎓 What Happened?

Railway deployed your Django code successfully, but Django needs a database to run. Think of it like this:

```
✅ Restaurant building built (Django code deployed)
❌ No kitchen installed (No PostgreSQL database)
→  Restaurant can't open without kitchen
```

**Adding PostgreSQL = Installing the kitchen**

Once you add it, everything works!

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Issue: "I don't see my project in Railway"

**Solution**:
- Make sure you're logged into Railway
- Check you pushed your code to GitHub
- Verify Railway is connected to your GitHub repo

### Issue: "PostgreSQL added but still failing"

**Solution**:
1. Check logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` exists in Variables tab
3. Restart web service: `railway restart`

### Issue: "Database connected but no comedores on map"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Import the data
railway run python importar_comedores.py

# Verify
railway run python manage.py shell -c "from apps.comedores.models import Comedor; print(Comedor.objects.count())"
```

## ⏭️ Next Steps

1. **Add PostgreSQL to Railway** (2 minutes)
2. **Import comedores data** (1 minute)
3. **Create admin user** (1 minute)
4. **Celebrate!** You have a live app with 265 comedores 🎉

## 💡 Why PostgreSQL?

- **Production-ready**: SQLite is for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Better performance**: Handles concurrent users
- **Railway integration**: Automatic backups, monitoring, scaling
- **Free tier**: 1GB database included
